This section contains an Ice Staff firing setup composed of a client controller, a server controller, and a ragdoll helper. 
The client handles animations, aiming, wrist tweens, and projectile VFX.  
The server validates hits, mirrors basic projectile motion, and applies ragdoll/respawn effects.

IceStaff.client.lua is the client controller, parented to the tool.
  - Loads and plays the staff animation, rotates the character to face the cursor, and tweens the wrist to aim
  - Computes tween timing vs. animation length and fires the server with a camera ray via fireStaffRE
  - Spawns and drives a local ice orb VFX toward the server-provided target and distance, then emits a burst and cleans up
  - Manages temporary movement lock, hand visibility, and debounce during the firing sequence

IceStaff.lua is the server controller. 
  - Performs a server-side raycast (excluding the shooter and their character) and creates a server orb that moves on Heartbeat
  - Notifies the client with the impact position and distance to drive VFX, and mirrors basic orb travel server-side
  - Detects orb touch on humanoids, clones a ragdoll corpse, runs onDied effects, then fades the original model back in and restores it to Workspace
  - Uses simple guards/debounce and cleans up connections and temporary parts

Ragdoll.lua is the ragdoll helper, parented to IceStaff.lua
  - .Clone() produces a ragdoll-like corpse model from the target and describes physics logic. 
  - .onDied() triggers the ragdoll/death sequence and returns when finished
